Form Element 
==============
Action = where the info is going
Method = GET or POST
- GET is for insensative info
- POST is for passing sensative info
- specifies the type of HTTP request by which you as the developer want to have your form information being transferred. 

Input Attribute
=================
Types: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type.asp
Once you have selected all of the input elements you want to include on your form; you must give each of them a name attribute if you want the inputs to be recognized by your server side code.  
This name attribute is how the data gets referred to on the back end.

once submitted: var_dump($_POST);

$_GET and $_POST are called superglobals; 
- they are only available for one URL request on the page once they are created.  

==========================================
SESSION
==========================================

$_SESSION is a superglobal that lets us save vales and have them be available from page to page until we decide to remove them
$_SESSION values get stored on the server so we have to have a way of retreiving them each time a new request is made
$_SESSION gives us a way of identifying each visitor that comes to our site by saving a cookie

each pages that you would liek to add, remove or update a value to $_SESSION you have to put session_start() at the top

process.php
<?php
session_start();
$_SESSION['name'] = "Carlos";
$_SESSION['occupation'] = "CEO";

if(isset($_POST['music']))
{
	$_SESSION['music'] = $_POST['music'];
}
?>


$_SESSION is a special type of array that will only allow you to add values with an association
